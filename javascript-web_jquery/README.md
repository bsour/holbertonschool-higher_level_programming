## Task Descriptions

This project includes several tasks, each designed to illustrate specific concepts and techniques related to web development with JavaScript and jQuery. Below is a brief overview of each task:

1. **No jQuery**: Update the text color of the `<header>` element to red (#FF0000) using `document.querySelector`.

2. **With jQuery**: Update the text color of the `<header>` element to red (#FF0000) using the jQuery API.

3. **Click and Turn Red**: Update the text color of the `<header>` element to red (#FF0000) when the user clicks on a `<div>` element, utilizing the jQuery API.

4. **Add `.red` Class**: Add the class `.red` to the `<header>` element when the user clicks on a `<div>` element, leveraging the jQuery API.

5. **Toggle Classes**: Toggle the class of the `<header>` element between `red` and `green` when the user clicks on a `<div>` element, using the jQuery API.

6. **Change the Text**: Update the text of the `<header>` element to "New Header!!!" when the user clicks on a `<div>` element, with the help of the jQuery API.

7. **Star Wars Character**: Fetch and display a character's name from a Star Wars API and show it in a `<div>` element using the jQuery API.

8. **Star Wars Movies**: Fetch and list movie titles from a Star Wars API, displaying them in a `<ul>` element with the ID `list_movies` using the jQuery API.

9. **Say Hello!**: Fetch and display the translation of "hello" from a translation API in a `<div>` element with the ID `hello` using the jQuery API.

## Project Overview

This project is a great resource for learning and practicing web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, API requests, and jQuery usage. Each task demonstrates a specific skill or technique that is commonly used in front-end web development.

## Usage

To run and test each task, follow the instructions provided in the corresponding HTML test files. Each task has its own HTML file (e.g., `0-main.html`, `1-main.html`, etc.) that you can open in your web browser to see the script in action.
