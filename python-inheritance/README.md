# Project Title

Python Inheritance

## Description

This project contains several Python scripts that demonstrate the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming. Each script focuses on a specific aspect of inheritance and provides examples and implementations to illustrate the concepts.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the desired script to explore the code examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-inheritance.git
cd python-inheritance
```

## List of Scripts

1. `0-lookup.py`: Returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.
2. `1-my_list.py`: Defines a class `MyList` that inherits from `list` and provides a method to print the list in sorted order.
3. `2-is_same_class.py`: Defines a function that checks if an object is an instance of a specified class.
4. `3-is_kind_of_class.py`: Defines a function that checks if an object is an instance of, or inherits from, a specified class.
5. `4-inherits_from.py`: Defines a function that checks if an object inherits from a specified class.
6. `5-base_geometry.py`: Defines an empty class `BaseGeometry`.
7. `6-base_geometry.py`: Defines a class `BaseGeometry` with a method that raises an exception.
8. `7-base_geometry.py`: Defines a class `BaseGeometry` with a method that validates an integer value.
9. `8-rectangle.py`: Defines a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and represents a rectangle with width and height.
10. `9-rectangle.py`: Defines a class `Rectangle` with an overridden method to print rectangle description.
11. `10-square.py`: Defines a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and represents a square.

## Usage

Each script can be executed independently by running the corresponding file.

```bash
python3 0-lookup.py
```

Review the code within each script to understand the concepts and see the examples in action.
