## Description

Welcome to the Python - Test-driven Development project! This project is aimed at demonstrating the concept and practice of test-driven development (TDD) in Python. Test-driven development is an approach where tests are written before writing the actual code, helping to improve code quality, maintainability, and overall development process.

## Features

- Learn the fundamentals of test-driven development
- Understand the benefits of test-driven development
- Explore practical examples and case studies of test-driven development in Python

## Installation

To use the Python - Test-driven Development project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-tdd.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd python-tdd
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can run the provided test cases and explore the test-driven development process. Follow these steps:
