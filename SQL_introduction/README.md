## Project Description

This project consists of a series of SQL assignments and tasks designed to reinforce the understanding of SQL concepts and database management. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific task or project completed as part of the Holberton School SQL curriculum.

The project covers a wide range of SQL topics, including but not limited to:
- Creating and managing databases
- Designing tables and schemas
- Querying data using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and other SQL commands
- Using various SQL clauses such as JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, etc.
- Database normalization and optimization
- Views, indexes, and triggers
- Stored procedures and functions

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/holberton-sql-project.git
```

2. [Optional] If you want to use a specific database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), make sure it is installed and properly configured on your machine.

3. Navigate to the specific task or project folder you want to explore and review the instructions and requirements.

## SQL Scripts

Each task or project folder contains one or more SQL scripts that implement the required functionality or queries. The script files are usually named according to the task or concept they cover, making it easy to identify the relevant files.

## Usage

To use the SQL scripts, you can execute them using the command-line interface of your preferred database management system. For example, if you are using MySQL, you can use the following command to execute a script:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < script_file.sql
```

Make sure to replace `your_username` and `your_database_name` with appropriate values.
