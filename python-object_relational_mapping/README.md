# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) - Holberton School Project

Welcome to the Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Holberton School project repository! This project is part of our curriculum at Holberton School, where we explore the world of object-relational mapping and learn how to interact with databases in Python using an ORM.

## Introduction

An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using object-oriented paradigms. In this project, we aim to create a custom ORM for Python, which enables us to work with databases without writing raw SQL queries. By leveraging the power of Python and the principles of object-oriented programming, we can easily map database tables to Python classes and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations seamlessly.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a lightweight and easy-to-use ORM for Python. It will provide functionalities for:

- Defining database models as Python classes.
- Mapping Python objects to corresponding database tables and vice versa.
- Performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database records.
- Supporting relationships between database tables (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
- Querying the database using high-level Python functions instead of writing raw SQL queries.

## Features

- Define models using Python classes and map them to database tables.
- Create new records in the database using Python objects.
- Retrieve records from the database based on various criteria.
- Update existing records in the database.
- Delete records from the database.
- Support relationships between models.
- Query the database using Pythonic syntax.

## Installation

To use our custom ORM for your Python projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Now you can start using the ORM in your Python code!

## Usage

To get started with using our custom ORM, follow the instructions below:

1. Import the necessary modules:

   ```python
   from orm import Model, StringField, IntegerField, create_tables
   ```

2. Define your models as Python classes, inheriting from the `Model` base class:

   ```python
   class User(Model):
       table_name = "users"
       id = IntegerField(primary_key=True)
       name = StringField()
       age = IntegerField()
   ```

3. Initialize the database and create the tables:

   ```python
   from orm import Database

   # Replace 'your-database-url' with your actual database URL
   db = Database('your-database-url')
   create_tables(db)
   ```

4. Start interacting with your models:

   ```python
   # Create a new user
   user = User(name="John Doe", age=30)
   user.save()

   # Retrieve users with a specific age
   users_with_age_30 = User.select().where(User.age == 30)

   # Update a user's name
   user.name = "Jane Smith"
   user.save()

   # Delete a user
   user.delete()
   ```

For more advanced usage and examples, refer to the documentation and code samples in the repository.
