# Python Everything is Object

This repository contains the solutions to tasks related to the "Python Everything is Object" topic. Each task is implemented in Python and provides insights into the behavior of objects and their properties in Python.

## Task Answers

The tasks are as follows:

0. Who am I?
   - Use the `type` function to print the type of an object.

1. Where are you?
   - Use the `id` function to get the variable identifier (memory address) in CPython.

2. Right count
   - Check if two variables point to the same object using the `is` operator.

3. Right count =
   - Check if two variables point to the same object using the `is` operator.

4. Right count =
   - Check if two variables point to the same object using the `is` operator.

5. Right count =+
   - Check if two variables point to the same object using the `is` operator.

6. Is equal
   - Check if two objects have the same value using the `==` operator.

7. Is the same
   - Check if two objects are the same using the `is` operator.

8. Is really equal
   - Check if two objects have the same value using the `==` operator.

9. Is really the same
   - Check if two objects are the same using the `is` operator.

10. And with a list, is it equal
    - Check if two lists have the same value using the `==` operator.

11. And with a list, is it the same
    - Check if two lists are the same using the `is` operator.

12. And with a list, is it really equal
    - Check if two lists have the same value using the `==` operator.

13. And with a list, is it really the same
    - Check if two lists are the same using the `is` operator.

14. List append
    - Demonstrate the behavior of the `append` method for lists.

15. List add
    - Demonstrate the behavior of the `+` operator for lists.

16. Integer incrementation
    - Demonstrate the behavior of the `+=` operator for integers.

17. List incrementation
    - Demonstrate the behavior of the `+=` operator for lists.

18. List assignation
    - Demonstrate the behavior of assignment for lists.

19. Copy a list object
    - Create a function to copy a list object without reference.

20. Tuple or not?
    - Check if a variable is a tuple using the `isinstance` function.

21. Tuple or not?
    - Check if a variable is a tuple using the `isinstance` function.

22. Tuple or not?
    - Check if a variable is a tuple using the `isinstance` function.

23. Tuple or not?
    - Check if a variable is a tuple using the `isinstance` function.

24. Who I am?
    - Demonstrate the behavior of assigning a variable without a value.

25. Tuple or not
    - Check if a variable is a tuple using the `isinstance` function.

26. Empty is not empty
    - Demonstrate the behavior of empty tuples.

27. Still the same?
    - Demonstrate the behavior of assignment and object reassignment.

28. Same or not?
    - Demonstrate the behavior of assignment and object reassignment.

29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!
